This project is a simulation of a flock of paper plane boids. The boids are controlled by three simple rules: separation, alignment, and cohesion. Made by [@EliottDvx](https://github.com/EliottDvx) and [@baptistejouin](https://github.com/baptistejouin).

The whole project is written in C++ with OpenGL and GLSL for rendering and is part of the Programming 2 course at IMAC engeenering school.
